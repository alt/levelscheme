# levelscheme
levelscheme is a LaTeX package that offers an easy way of drawing atomic and molecular level schemes in a LaTeX document.

## installation
The dtx file has to be compiled with XeLaTeX in order to get the pdf documentation. (luaLaTeX should be fine, too.) The package itself can be used with any up-to-date LaTeX-flavour.

## requirements
This package requires the expl3 packages, xparse and the TikZ bundle. Make shure all are installed and up to date.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome! Help me improve this package!

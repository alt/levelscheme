levelscheme tries to offer an easy way of drawing atomic/molecular level schemes in a LaTeX document.

The dtx file has to be compiled with XeLaTeX in order to get the pdf documentation. The package itself can be used with any LaTeX-flavour.

Any comments are welcome! \emph{Please} help me improve this package!

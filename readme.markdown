# levelscheme
levelscheme is a LaTeX package that offers an easy way of drawing atomic and molecular level schemes in a LaTeX document.

## installation
Compile the dtx file with XeLaTeX to get the documentation (pdf) as well as the package code (.sty).
The dtx file has to be compiled with XeLaTeX (luaLaTeX should be fine, too, but not pdf- or dviLaTeX.) The package itself can be used with any up-to-date LaTeX-flavour.

## requirements
This package requires the expl3 packages, xparse and the TikZ bundle. Make shure all are installed and up to date.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome! Iâ€™m trying to make this package as user-friendly as possible, therefore I need your feedback.
Help me improve this package!
